Goals for the rest of the day: 
    CHECK | Complete cubelet::rotate for x, y and z 
    Create a function in cube that determines what cubes to rotate for each function (top, front, back, etc.)
    Init the panels the right way
    Determine whether I'm going to simp over React or continue to torture myself with JQuery
        If I'm going to continue with JQuery, I have to do some research AND I need to crete a canvas object
        If I'm going through with React, I need to think through whethe there will be any porting issues

Notes: 
    In some free time, I need to design the UI

Next session: 
    I need to rigure out how I want to animate the cube
